"""
A supervisor is using the TaskManagementSystem to manage tasks for his workers.
The system can add users, assign tasks to users, and get task(s) that belong
to a specific user.

You can not modify user or task class.
self.users and self.tasks in TaskManagementSystem has to remain as lists.
You can introduce new methods and class variables.

Goals:

DONE - Fix the syntax and semantic bugs that prevent the program from running correctly.

DONE - Change get_user_tasks() to return list of task names instead of task objects.

DONE: Add error handling to add_user(), add_task(), and get_user_tasks() methods

Done - CONDITIONALLY: Optimize TaskManagementSystem to handle large number of users and tasks
- Condition:
    - This will handle as many users as you have memory for.

    - Since the users are in dictionaries, truly large numbers of users (millions) will cause the system to likely
      run out of memory.  Ideally, this should be backed by a database.  Even something like SQLite would be really
      helpful here, because memory would be conserved.

      In beginners hour, if there's time, we'll try adding a SQLite persistence layer to this.
