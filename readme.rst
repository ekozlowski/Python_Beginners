If You Are On Windows
---------------------

Install Anaconda - https://www.continuum.io/downloads  Comes bundled with tons of goodies for scientific computing, and great utilities like IPython Notebook (Now Jupyter) right out of the box.

If You Are On Mac
-----------------

Congratulations!  Python is built into Mac OSX!  However, you may run across people that swear by "brew installing" Python.  This is because if Apple updates Python, it may mess with anything third-party that you have installed if you use the system installed Python.  Brew installing Python gets around that.

If You Are On *nix
------------------

Congratulations!  Python is usually packaged with most \*nix installs!
